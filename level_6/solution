find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null

The above command finds a file somewhere on the filesystem with an owner of user bandit7
and group bandit6 that is of size 33 bytes.
It then passes the found results to an exec command to cat the file and redirects
stderr (2) to null, because this command produces errors on files it can't read.
