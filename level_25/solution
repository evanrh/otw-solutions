VIM command: :e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

In this level, the shell is not bash. You can find a user's shell by looking in /etc/passwd.
e.g. cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26

This points us to a shell script which opens a file in more, then exits.
On the surface, there really isn't anything we can do, but if the window is small enough, more overfills instead of exiting.
Once it is in this state, we can then open VIM by typing 'v', and then open the password file from VIM.
