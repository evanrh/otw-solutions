cat data.txt | xxd -r | gunzip | bunzip2 | gunzip | tar -xO | tar -xO | bunzip2 | tar -xO | gunzip

The long pipeline above takes the first file and decompresses it several times, based off of the type of file it is.
The file type for each stage was first found by piping the output to "file -".
After this was done, the file would then be put through whichever decompression algorithm was necessary and repeated.
xxd -r Reverses a binary dump of a file, and the -xO flag for tar outputs to stdout.
tar does not typically output to stdout, so this was necessary.
