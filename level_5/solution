Learned how to use find for this one.
Find has several flags that are useful here: -readable, -size, and -executable.
The readable takes no arguements, and size takes a number followed by a letter denoting what denomination of size, in this case, c for bytes, so 1033c.
The executable flag tells if a file is executable.
